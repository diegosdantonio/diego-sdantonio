abstract: This paper introduces a method to enforce balanced power distribution between the stages of a single-phase transformer-based cascaded multilevel inverter using the new asymmetric ratio 6:7:8:9 between stages. Since the inverter is fed by a single DC source, asymmetry is enforced by means of the transformer turns ratio providing multiple redundant switching patterns to synthesize an output signal of until 35 levels. As it is developed in the paper, optimum switching patterns for the proposed ratio allow reducing typical power unbalance produced by commonly used ratios in four stage multilevel inverters (1:2:4:8 and 1:3:9:27). The proposed method consists on determining off-line the best switching patterns for minimizing deviation error, and then, storing them as lock-up tables in the digital device controlling the inverter. By permanently reproducing the selected switching patterns, balanced power distribution is achieved. A closed-loop control approach to regulate the RMS value of the output voltage compatible with the proposed method is also developed. The experimental results using a laboratory prototype are presented validating the entire approach.
