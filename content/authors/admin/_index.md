Electronic engineer entrepreneur, self-taught, responsible, creative, and goal-oriented. He is currently a Ph.D. student to earn his Doctoral in Computer Science and Engineering at **["Lehigh University"](https://www1.lehigh.edu/)**, He is active member of Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics Laboratory **["AIRLab"]( https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/robotics/)**. He received his BSc. degree in electronic engineering. He is candidate to earn his MSc. in control engineering at the University of Ibague, Colombia, where he was an instructor in the faculty of engineering. This MSc. program in control engineering has been created as a result of fruitful academic cooperation between the university of ibaguè, the **["Catholic University of Leuven"](https://www.kuleuven.be/english//)** and the **["University of Ghent"](https://www.ugent.be/)** in Belgium.

He worked for a company called “Ideas Disruptivas” in Mexico, whereas project manager he helped develop the first Mexican 3D printer, with a clear educational purpose. The most outstanding project I have worked on is called “pretty hand”, where a mechanical-electronic hand was designed for people needing hand prosthesis; it was a low-cost social project. He is currently chair of the IEEE student branch chapter and chair industrial application society at the University of Ibague. His current research topics include power electronics, robustness, and advanced control, renewable energy systems, where he has written several papers. He is fond of robotic systems.
