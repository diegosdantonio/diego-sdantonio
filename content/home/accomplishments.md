  The MathWorks Minidrone Competitions pretended to introduce participants into Model-Based Design using Simulink. The participants had to design a line follower algorithm for a minidrone. The competition consisted of two rounds. Teams that passed from Round 1 were invited to participate in Round 2. This competition was hosted by MathWorks.
  
- Round 1 Simulation: Design of virtual algorithms by using Simulink.
- Round 2 Simulation and Hardware Deployment: Deployment of the algorithm designed in round 1, on a Parrot minidrone.
