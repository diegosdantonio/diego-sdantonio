The Pretty Hand is a project that began after meeting Samuel, a 4-year-old Colombian boy. Who, as he describes us, was born with a beautiful hand. From this, an alliance was created between the companies "Colombian Robotics Engineering" and "Ideas Disruptivas" from Mexico. The Pretty Hand project was seeks to develop a low-cost prosthesis for Samuel.
