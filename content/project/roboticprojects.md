SIRUI is research hotbed from the Engineering Research Group D+TEC. This initiative consists in an extra-class space where the engineering students create their own robotic platforms (Hardware and Software) according to their interests.

These low-cost developments involve prototyping tasks, handling of tools and equipment (3D print, laser cutter, PCB plotter, soldering), design and electronic implementation (Electronic simulation [Proteus], manufacture of PCBs), modeling and control (Dynamic simulation [MATLAB], Perception adaptations) and digital programing (Assembly, C, C++, Python, ROS, OpenCV).
