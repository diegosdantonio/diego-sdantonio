Currently, the use of Drones, in precision agriculture, is of vital importance for the transport of agricultural materials, crop monitoring, cartographic mapping in relief, among others. Of the union between D + TEC group Unibague  and Fedearroz borned a project about to research in precision agriculture. The aim is detect causes stress in rice. This can be determined in using high resolution, multispectral and thermographic cameras.
